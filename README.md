# Stopwatch
This VHDL project implements a 4-digit timer on a 7-segment display. It includes clock dividers for timing, a 2-bit counter for digit cycling, a 4-digit counter (0-9999), and a decoder multiplexer for display control. Supports start/stop, reset, and dynamic time display using efficient multiplexing.
